'  ShadowFlare MPQ API Library. (c) ShadowFlare Software 2002-2010
'  License information for this code is in license.txt and
'  included in this file at the end of this comment.

'  All functions below are actual functions that are part of this
'  library and do not need any additional dll files.  It does not
'  even require Storm to be able to decompress or compress files.

'  This library emulates the interface of Lmpqapi and Storm MPQ
'  functions, so it may be used as a replacement for them in
'  MPQ extractors/archivers without even needing to recompile
'  the program that uses Lmpqapi or Storm.  It has a few features
'  not included in Lmpqapi and Storm, such as extra flags for some
'  functions, setting the locale ID of existing files, and adding
'  files without having to write them somewhere else first.  Also,
'  MPQ handles used by functions prefixed with "SFile" and "Mpq"
'  can be used interchangably; all functions use the same type
'  of MPQ handles.  You cannot, however, use handles from this
'  library with storm or lmpqapi or vice-versa.  Doing so will
'  most likely result in a crash.

'  Revision History:
'  (Release date) 1.08 (ShadowFlare)
'  - Fixed a buffer overflow that would occur when reading files
'    if neither using a buffer that is large enough to contain the
'    entire file nor has a size that is a multiple of 4096
'  - Added SFileOpenFileAsArchive which opens an archive that is
'    contained within an already open archive
'  - Added MpqRenameAndSetFileLocale and MpqDeleteFileWithLocale.
'    These have extra parameters that allow you to use them with
'    files having language codes other than what was last set
'    using SFileSetLocale
'  - Fixed a bug that caused (listfile) to get cleared if adding
'    files with a locale ID other than 0
'  - Added MpqOpenArchiveForUpdateEx which allows creating
'    archives with different block sizes
'  - SFileListFiles can list the contents of bncache.dat without
'    needing an external list

'  06/12/2002 1.07 (ShadowFlare)
'  - No longer requires Storm.dll to compress or decompress
'    Warcraft III files
'  - Added SFileListFiles for getting names and information
'    about all of the files in an archive
'  - Fixed a bug with renaming and deleting files
'  - Fixed a bug with adding wave compressed files with
'    low compression setting
'  - Added a check in MpqOpenArchiveForUpdate for proper
'    dwMaximumFilesInArchive values (should be a number that
'    is a power of 2).  If it is not a proper value, it will
'    be rounded up to the next higher power of 2

'  05/09/2002 1.06 (ShadowFlare)
'  - Compresses files without Storm.dll!
'  - If Warcraft III is installed, this library will be able to
'    find Storm.dll on its own. (Storm.dll is needed to
'    decompress Warcraft III files)
'  - Fixed a bug where an embedded archive and the file that
'    contains it would be corrupted if the archive was modified
'  - Able to open all .w3m maps now

'  29/06/2002 1.05 (ShadowFlare)
'  - Supports decompressing files from Warcraft III MPQ archives
'    if using Storm.dll from Warcraft III
'  - Added MpqAddFileToArchiveEx and MpqAddFileFromBufferEx for
'    using extra compression types

'  29/05/2002 1.04 (ShadowFlare)
'  - Files can be compressed now!
'  - Fixed a bug in SFileReadFile when reading data not aligned
'    to the block size
'  - Optimized some of SFileReadFile's code.  It can read files
'    faster now
'  - SFile functions may now be used to access files not in mpq
'    archives as you can with the real storm functions
'  - MpqCompactArchive will no longer corrupt files with the
'    MODCRYPTKEY flag as long as the file is either compressed,
'    listed in "(listfile)", is "(listfile)", or is located in
'    the same place in the compacted archive; so it is safe
'    enough to use it on almost any archive
'  - Added MpqAddWaveFromBuffer
'  - Better handling of archives with no files
'  - Fixed compression with COMPRESS2 flag

'  15/05/2002 1.03 (ShadowFlare)
'  - Supports adding files with the compression attribute (does
'    not actually compress files).  Now archives created with
'    this dll can have files added to them through lmpqapi
'    without causing staredit to crash
'  - SFileGetBasePath and SFileSetBasePath work more like their
'    Storm equivalents now
'  - Implemented MpqCompactArchive, but it is not finished yet.
'    In its current state, I would recommend against using it
'    on archives that contain files with the MODCRYPTKEY flag,
'    since it will corrupt any files with that flag
'  - Added SFMpqGetVersionString2 which may be used in Visual
'    Basic to get the version string

'  07/05/2002 1.02 (ShadowFlare)
'  - SFileReadFile no longer passes the lpOverlapped parameter it
'    receives to ReadFile.  This is what was causing the function
'    to fail when used in Visual Basic
'  - Added support for more Storm MPQ functions
'  - GetLastError may now be used to get information about why a
'    function failed

'  01/05/2002 1.01 (ShadowFlare)
'  - Added ordinals for Storm MPQ functions
'  - Fixed MPQ searching functionality of SFileOpenFileEx
'  - Added a check for whether a valid handle is given when
'    SFileCloseArchive is called
'  - Fixed functionality of SFileSetArchivePriority when multiple
'    files are open
'  - File renaming works for all filenames now
'  - SFileReadFile no longer reallocates the buffer for each block
'    that is decompressed.  This should make SFileReadFile at least
'    a little faster

'  30/04/2002 1.00 (ShadowFlare)
'  - First version.
'  - Compression not yet supported
'  - Does not use SetLastError yet, so GetLastError will not return any
'    errors that have to do with this library
'  - MpqCompactArchive not implemented
