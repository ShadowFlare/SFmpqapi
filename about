<title>About ShadowFlare MPQ API Library</title>
<pre>  ShadowFlare MPQ API Library v1.08 (c) ShadowFlare Software 2002-2010

  This library emulates the interface of Lmpqapi and Storm MPQ
  functions, so it may be used as a replacement for them in
  MPQ extractors/archivers without even needing to recompile
  the program that uses Lmpqapi or Storm.  It has a few features
  not included in Lmpqapi and Storm, such as extra flags for some
  functions, setting the locale ID of existing files, and adding
  files without having to write them somewhere else first.  Also,
  MPQ handles used by functions prefixed with "SFile" and "Mpq"
  can be used interchangably; all functions use the same type
  of MPQ handles.  You cannot, however, use handles from this
  library with storm or lmpqapi or vice-versa.  Doing so will
  most likely result in a crash.

  This library does not require Storm to be able to decompress
  or compress files.

  Revision History:
  (Release date) 1.08 (<a href="mailto:blakflare@hotmail.com">ShadowFlare</a>)
  - Fixed a buffer overflow that would occur when reading files
    if neither using a buffer that is large enough to contain the
    entire file nor has a size that is a multiple of 4096
  - Added SFileOpenFileAsArchive which opens an archive that is
    contained within an already open archive
  - Added MpqRenameAndSetFileLocale and MpqDeleteFileWithLocale.
    These have extra parameters that allow you to use them with
    files having language codes other than what was last set
    using SFileSetLocale
  - Fixed a bug that caused (listfile) to get cleared if adding
    files with a locale ID other than 0
  - Added MpqOpenArchiveForUpdateEx which allows creating
    archives with different block sizes
  - SFileListFiles can list the contents of bncache.dat without
    needing an external list

  06/12/2002 1.07 (<a href="mailto:blakflare@hotmail.com">ShadowFlare</a>)
  - No longer requires Storm.dll to compress or decompress
    Warcraft III files
  - Added SFileListFiles for getting names and information
    about all of the files in an archive
  - Fixed a bug with renaming and deleting files
  - Fixed a bug with adding wave compressed files with
    low compression setting
  - Added a check in MpqOpenArchiveForUpdate for proper
    dwMaximumFilesInArchive values (should be a number that
    is a power of 2).  If it is not a proper value, it will
    be rounded up to the next higher power of 2

  05/09/2002 1.06 (<a href="mailto:blakflare@hotmail.com">ShadowFlare</a>)
  - Compresses files without Storm.dll!
  - If Warcraft III is installed, this library will be able to
    find Storm.dll on its own. (Storm.dll is needed to
    decompress Warcraft III files)
  - Fixed a bug where an embedded archive and the file that
    contains it would be corrupted if the archive was modified
  - Able to open all .w3m maps now

  29/06/2002 1.05 (<a href="mailto:blakflare@hotmail.com">ShadowFlare</a>)
  - Supports decompressing files from Warcraft III MPQ archives
    if using Storm.dll from Warcraft III
  - Added MpqAddFileToArchiveEx and MpqAddFileFromBufferEx for
    using extra compression types

  29/05/2002 1.04 (<a href="mailto:blakflare@hotmail.com">ShadowFlare</a>)
  - Files can be compressed now!
  - Fixed a bug in SFileReadFile when reading data not aligned
    to the block size
  - Optimized some of SFileReadFile's code.  It can read files
    faster now
  - SFile functions may now be used to access files not in mpq
    archives as you can with the real storm functions
  - MpqCompactArchive will no longer corrupt files with the
    MODCRYPTKEY flag as long as the file is either compressed,
    listed in "(listfile)", is "(listfile)", or is located in
    the same place in the compacted archive; so it is safe
    enough to use it on almost any archive
  - Added MpqAddWaveFromBuffer
  - Better handling of archives with no files
  - Fixed compression with COMPRESS2 flag

  15/05/2002 1.03 (<a href="mailto:blakflare@hotmail.com">ShadowFlare</a>)
  - Supports adding files with the compression attribute (does
    not actually compress files).  Now archives created with
    this dll can have files added to them through lmpqapi
    without causing staredit to crash
  - SFileGetBasePath and SFileSetBasePath work more like their
    Storm equivalents now
  - Implemented MpqCompactArchive, but it is not finished yet.
    In its current state, I would recommend against using it
    on archives that contain files with the MODCRYPTKEY flag,
    since it will corrupt any files with that flag
  - Added SFMpqGetVersionString2 which may be used in Visual
    Basic to get the version string

  07/05/2002 1.02 (<a href="mailto:blakflare@hotmail.com">ShadowFlare</a>)
  - SFileReadFile no longer passes the lpOverlapped parameter it
    receives to ReadFile.  This is what was causing the function
    to fail when used in Visual Basic
  - Added support for more Storm MPQ functions
  - GetLastError may now be used to get information about why a
    function failed

  01/05/2002 1.01 (<a href="mailto:blakflare@hotmail.com">ShadowFlare</a>)
  - Added ordinals for Storm MPQ functions
  - Fixed MPQ searching functionality of SFileOpenFileEx
  - Added a check for whether a valid handle is given when
    SFileCloseArchive is called
  - Fixed functionality of SFileSetArchivePriority when multiple
    files are open
  - File renaming works for all filenames now
  - SFileReadFile no longer reallocates the buffer for each block
    that is decompressed.  This should make SFileReadFile at least
    a little faster

  30/04/2002 1.00 (<a href="mailto:blakflare@hotmail.com">ShadowFlare</a>)
  - First version.
  - Compression not yet supported
  - Does not use SetLastError yet, so GetLastError will not return any
    errors that have to do with this library
  - MpqCompactArchive not implemented
